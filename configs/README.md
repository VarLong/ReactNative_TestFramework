Configs
==============

There are three kinds of environment/configs in this project:

1. The default config is defined in `wdio.default.json5`, which all other configs inherit from.
2. Dynamically configurations are generated by combining each of the top-level objects in `capabilities.json5` and `deployments.json5`.
3. Named environment/configs, which are individual files in `testEnvConfigs` folder. Use the filename as the `--env` environment parameter.

Config Merging
--------------

Config merging is shallow, You can have an environment config whose name also matches a generated config, to use special values in a targeted way.

    └── wdio.default.json5                      WebDriverIO DEFAULT config.

Guidelines
--------------

- use lowercase environment names and filenames.
- put test code specific key/values in an object called `locals` (or whatever, just be consistent) to avoid confusion with `wdio` configs.

Formats
--------------

Besides JSON, config files may also be in [JSON5](http://json5.org/) format. This allows Javascript style comments, single quoted key/values, and unquoted keys.

Implementation notes
--------------

When `wdio` starts, it's passed configuration that is gathered or generated by `wdio.conf.js`.
